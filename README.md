# Binary-Search-Tree-Visualizer
Displays a Binary Search Tree based on user input

This program reads a user file of integers and places them in a binary search tree. The program then visualizes the tree in a console with animations for the adding of nodes. It will also print the tree in NLR, LNR, and LRN formats.

It then allows users to add or remove a user defined node to the tree, where it will change the tree and reprint the visualization, along with the new formatting.
